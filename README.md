## üõ†Ô∏è Features
1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion** (using OpenAI Whisper)
2. **Audio Segmentation** (chunks of 5 seconds)
3. **Sentiment Analysis** (custom pre-trained transformer-based model)
4. **Timestamp Mapping**
5. **CSV Export using pandas**
6. **Visualization of Transcriptions and Sentiments**

All the documentation on how the code works are given above the code and its relevant outputs are mentioned below each cell
