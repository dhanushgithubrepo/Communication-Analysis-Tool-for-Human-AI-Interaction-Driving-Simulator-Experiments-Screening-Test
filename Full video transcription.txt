 Okay, so the drive you're going to complete will be used to be the automation and the object detection systems that means you will not need to operate the vehicle. You should keep your hands off the steering wheel and feed off the pedals once we move in that drive. Okay. So when you see that some driver indicator highlight green, make sure you don't hit the brake at any point during the drive. For this drive, the Car Cab Lookout will have the ODS for getting visual feedback for targets that are in the environment. So the Car Cab Lookout should pay attention to that screen to aid them when they're going out to turn to the mission. Remember to tap the targets on that ODS as well as completing those workstation tasks. Alright, so all drivers, put your foot on the brake. Do not remove your foot from the brake until I instruct you to remove it. Car Cab Driver, you may start the car. All drivers, with your foot still on the brake, you've been on the brake and you're not starting up. If you're still on the brake. You drove through me. Car Cab Driver. Any other? Go back.
